# vue-3-function-based-examples

> Examples built with the new Vue 3 function-based component API

## Getting Started

As announced, in version 3 of Vue.js (the release will probably be in the third quarter of 2019, you can see the complete roadmap [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/projects/6)) there will be an important introduction: the function-based component API. But what exactly are they?

Introduced as an RFC for 3.x, the new API presents a clean and flexible way to compose logic between and inside components. Must be specified that for now, it is an **open RFC** which means it's not set in stone and can change based on users feedback.

### Prerequisites  

For this project you need [__Node__](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine with [__Npm__](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [__Yarn__](https://yarnpkg.com).

**If you want** you can install the official [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). You can add it typing, inside a terminal:
```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

### Install the function-based API

You can install it, inside your Vue.js 2.x application via npm or yarn:

```
npm install vue-function-api
# OR
yarn add install vue-function-api
```
Or add it via CDN if you not using the CLI:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-function-api/dist/vue-function-api.umd.js"></script>
```

### Use the plugin
